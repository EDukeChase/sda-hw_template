# Documents Folder

This directory contains supplementary documents for the assignment, such as:

-   The official homework instructions or prompt (e.g., `.pdf`, `.docx`).
-   Any provided starter code files or `.qmd` templates that are part of the assignment itself.

Files in this folder are treated as **read-only** reference materials for the project.

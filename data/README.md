# Data Folder

Place all raw data files for the assignment in this directory. This includes files like:

  - `.csv` or `.xlsx` tables

  - Shapefiles (`.shp`, `.dbf`, etc.)

  - GeoJSON (`.geojson`) files

**Best Practice:** The files in this folder should be treated as **read-only**. Your analysis scripts should read data from here, but should never save or modify files in here.
